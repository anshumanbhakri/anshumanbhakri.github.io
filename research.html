        <h3><a href="https://github.com/AnshumanBhakri/project-1" target="_blank">Contract design in renewable energy auctions: Evidence from India</a></h3>
        <p>The procurement of green energy in the presence of cost uncertainty leads to the non-deployment of projects if the contracts are not optimally designed. This paper proposes the contract design for the Indian solar energy procurement auctions to help achieve their green energy targets while minimizing procurement costs. I examine how the developers, facing uncertain costs, lead to non-deployment under incomplete contracts and suggest alternative designs to mitigate these issues.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/AnshumanBhakri/project-2" target="_blank">How large are the cost savings from auctions vs feed-in tariffs: Evidence from Germany</a></h3>
        <p>In this project, we study the design of contracts for large-scale solar projects, focusing on how to incentivize timely deployment under cost uncertainties. The research incorporates data from Indian solar auctions and analyzes various contract structures, including penalty clauses.</p>
